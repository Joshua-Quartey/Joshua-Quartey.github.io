    "#### SECTION A: INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Global $CO_2$ emissions continue to drive climate change and pose urgent challenges for economies worldwide.  As countries invest in renewable energies like solar, wind, hydro, and biofuels, understanding the real-world impact of that shift on national emissions is critical for shaping effective policy and guiding private investment.  This project combines time-series data on the share of primary energy from renewables with annual $CO_2$ emissions, economic scale (GDP), population, and energy-intensity metrics to quantify how renewable adoption influences emissions trajectories.  By building both cross-sectional regressions and time-series forecasts, this project aims to explore the effect of renewable energy sources on emissions, offering actionable insights for policymakers and energy strategists committed to clean-energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Main Objective\n",
    "To quantify the relationship between the share of renewable energy in a country’s primary energy mix and its total CO₂ emissions—controlling for economic size, population, and energy efficiency—and to build a predictive time-series model for future emission trends."

    "The following datasets were selected for this analysis because together they capture the key supply‐side, demand‐side, and contextual drivers of national CO₂ emissions.  The renewables share data measures the pace of clean‐energy adoption. The $CO_2$ emissions dataset provides the data on the outcome of interest. The GDP and population datasets provide the data on the two indicators that will be used to control for economic scale and demographic differences that influence energy demand. The energy intensity data reflects how efficiently each economy converts energy into output.  Merging these datasets makes it possible to isolate the net effect of renewables over time while accounting for size, growth, and efficiency factors that would otherwise confound our estimates.\n",

In contrast, global energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) has steadily declined, which couldbe due to improvements in energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the share of renewables in primary energy has shown a consistent upward trend, especially accelerating after 2010.

    "   The model explains 85.5% of the variation in annual $CO_2$ emissions across country–year observations ($R^2 = 0.855$).  Controlling for economic scale (GDP) and population, the estimated coefficient on renewables_pct is $−3.485 × 10^6 (p < 0.001)$.  This means a one percentagepoint increase in the share of primary energy from renewables is associated with a reduction of about 3.5 million tonnes of $CO_2$ emissions on average when holding GDP and population constant. Also the coefficients of the other predictors indicate that higher GDP and larger population each predict greater total emissions ($p < 0.001$).\n",

    "   Interaction of Renewables and Energy Intensity\\\n",
    "   In this model, the overall fit improves slightly ($R^2 = 0.865$), and all key terms are statistically significant.  The main effect of renewables share is $–5.44 × 10^6 (p = 0.016)$, indicating that at the baseline energy‐intensity level, a one percentage point increase in renewables share is associated with 5.4 million fewer tonnes of $CO_2$.  The coefficient of energy intensity is $7.86 × 10^6 (p < 0.001)$ which confirms that more energy‐intensive economies emit substantially more $CO_2$.  Also, the positive interaction term(renewables_pct x energy_intensity = $1.11 × 10^6; p = 0.027$) indicates that the effect of reducing emissions that renewables have is reduced in economies with higher energy intensity.\n",

This indicates a weak but statistically highly significant negative relationship. That is, countries with higher proportions of primary energy consumption coming from renewables tend to have slightly lower $CO_2$ emissions on a per-person basis.  The small p-value ($p < 0.001$) means we can confidently reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation in favor of the alternative that the association is non-zero. The magnitude of $r (–0.19)$ also suggests that renewables share alone explains only about 3.6% of the variability in $CO_2$ per capita $(r^Z \\approx 0.036)$ which is a small effect.\n",

    "\tForecast Accuracy & Exogenous Effect of Renewables\\\n",
    "\tIncorporating renewable share as an exogenous regressor in a $SARIMAX(1,1,1)$ model yields a significant negative coefficient of $–4.44 × 10^6 (p < 0.001)$, which indicates that a percentage‐point increase in renewables share corresponds to about 4.4 million fewer tonnes of $CO_2$, all other factors held constant. On the test set, the model achieves an RMSE of approximately 13.6 million tonnes.  Although the absolute errors are sizable the model only explains about 17% of out of sample variance ($R^2 = 0.167$), suggesting that while renewables share is a meaningful driver, other factors (e.g., economic structure shifts, policy changes, etc) also play major roles in emission fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe AR(1) coefficient (0.932) and MA(1) coefficient (−0.914) remain highly significant ($p < 0.001$), which indicates that past emission levels strongly inform current values.  The diagnostic tests (Ljung–Box $Q = 0.32$, $p = 0.57$; Jarque–Bera $p = 0.54$) indicate that there is no serious residual autocorrelation or non‐normality.  Overall, the SARIMAX model shows that renewable adoption has a downward effect on emissions but its moderate performance highlights the need to incorporate additional variables or more flexible modeling approaches for more accurate predictions.\n",
