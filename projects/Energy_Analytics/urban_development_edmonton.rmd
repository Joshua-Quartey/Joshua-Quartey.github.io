#### Urban & Housing Analytics: Understanding Urban Development Patterns in Edmonton
Objective:

To explore how construction activityâ€”measured through building permits and construction valueâ€”reflects broader trends in zoning policy, urban development, and changing property values across Edmonton from 2009 to 2023.

Methodology:

Analyzed City of Edmonton building permit data to track construction volume and investment by neighborhood and permit type.
Investigated correlations between construction activity and property assessment values to assess patterns of reinvestment.
Integrated contextual policy changes (e.g., 2020 City Plan, 2024 Zoning Bylaw) to frame development shifts.
Tools/Technologies:

pandas, Tableau, seaborn, geopandas

Key Findings and Results:

A small number of neighborhoods (e.g., Glenora, Oliver, and Garneau) accounted for a disproportionately large share of high-value permits.
Older neighborhoods with infill potential showed rising permit activity, suggesting gentrification trends.
Redevelopment and construction value were unevenly distributed across the city, raising concerns about equitable investment and accessibility.
